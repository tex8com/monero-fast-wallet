# Wallet Core Testbench

This testbench is the acceptance layer for the wallet brain before React
Native is treated as complete.

It deliberately covers more than the current implementation can pass. Missing
Ledger BLE, hosted scanner block matching, mobile device execution, or funded
send credentials are reported as open gates, not silently skipped.

## Commands

Local development inventory:

```sh
tools/wallet-testbench/run-wallet-core-testbench.sh local
```

Strict full acceptance:

```sh
tools/wallet-testbench/run-wallet-core-testbench.sh full
```

`full` requires real node/device/funded-wallet configuration and exits non-zero
when any required gate is missing.

The runner must not print seeds, private spend keys, private view keys, wallet
passwords, daemon passwords, push tokens, or raw Ledger messages.

Prefer `*_PASSWORD_FILE` over inline password environment variables. The native
proof runner accepts password arguments as `@/path/to/password-file`, so real
send tests do not need wallet credentials in process logs.

On this Mac, the linked Monero build should stay on `/Volumes/4TB` because the
internal disk is too tight for repeat wallet-core builds.

Use the public server IP for node tests. `tex8.com` is routed through
Cloudflare and is not suitable for raw Monero RPC/gRPC ports.
